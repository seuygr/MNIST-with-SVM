# MNIST-with-SVM

Two methods(Matlab and Python) for Handwritting digit classification are covered here.

One is using sk-learn package in Python, which performs pretty well. 

And the other is using CVX tool in Matlab. With CVX, hard-margin, soft-margin and kernel trick are performed.  

The loading functions, loadMNISTImages.m and loadMNISTLabels.m, come from http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Using_the_MNIST_Dataset
